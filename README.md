# HAGCS
A hybrid self-adaptive gradient-based cuckoo search (HAGCS) for global optimization problems

# Environment
- Matlab2019a

# Get Started
- Add folder "libs_global_optimization" as library (Add to path -> Selected folder and subfolders)
- run testCompareMethodsFinal.m to compare the performance of different global optimization algorithms 
- run testSelfAdaptation.m to show the self-adapting of the 9 control parameters of the HAGCS as a function of generation index $t$
