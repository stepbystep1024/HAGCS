function nests = bsGetCuckoosWithGradient(beta, nests, gradient, bestNest, Lb, Ub, alpha)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% A subroutine of the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm
% To get some new cuckoos with gradient information
%
% I re-organize this code as a seperate function is because it would be better
% to develop more programs using some common subroutines.

    % Levy flights
    [nDim, nNest] = size(nests);

    %% Levy flights by Mantegna'nest algorithm
%     steps = bsLevy(size(nests, 1), nNest, beta);
    
    for j = 1 : nNest
        nest = nests(:, j);
        step = bsLevy(nDim, 1, beta);
        step = step .* (nest - bestNest);
        % In the next equation, the difference factor (nest-bestNest) means that 
        % when the solution is the bestNest solution, it remains unchanged.     
        stepsize = alpha * abs(step) .* sign(-gradient(:, j));
        % Here the factor 0.01 comes from the fact that L/100 should the typical
        % step size of walks/flights where L is the typical lenghtscale; 
        % otherwise, Levy flights may become too aggresive/efficient, 
        % which makes new solutions (even) jump out side of the design domain 
        % (and thus wasting evaluations).
        % Now the actual random walks or flights
%         nest = nest + stepsize .* abs(randn(size(nest)));
        nest = nest + stepsize;
        
        % Apply simple bounds/limits
        nests(:, j) = bsSimpleBounds(nest, Lb, Ub);
